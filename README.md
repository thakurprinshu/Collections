# 📚 Collections in Java

This repository contains implementations and problem-solving examples using **Java Collections Framework (JCF)**.  
I have organized the work into different branches based on the collection type:

- 🔗 **LinkedList**
- 📦 **Stack**
- 🎯 **Queue**
- 📋 **ArrayList**

Each branch demonstrates **theory, common operations, and interview-style problems** solved using that collection.

## 🚀 Repository Structure
- `main` → Project overview (this branch, README)
- `linkedlist` → LinkedList problems and solutions
- `stack` → Stack problems (e.g., Valid Parentheses, Next Greater Element, Min Stack, etc.)
- `queue` → Queue variations (Queue using Array/LinkedList, Queue using Two Stacks, Circular Queue, Deque, Sliding Window Maximum, etc.)
- `arraylist` → ArrayList operations (duplicates, intersection, union, palindrome check, reverse, sort, etc.)

### 🔗 LinkedList
- Create and traverse linked lists
- Insert at beginning, end, and specific position
- Delete operations
- Reverse linked list
- Detect cycle in linked list

### 📦 Stack
- Valid Parentheses
- Next Greater Element
- Min Stack
- Evaluate Reverse Polish Notation
- Largest Rectangle in Histogram

### 🎯 Queue
- Simple Queue (Array / LinkedList)
- Queue using 2 Stacks
- Circular Queue
- Deque (Double Ended Queue)
- Sliding Window Maximum
